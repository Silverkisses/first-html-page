        <p>Greetings! I am a 5 foot tall hispanic woman. Since a young age I have always had a passion for computers and technology.
            Unfortunately when growing up, females weren't as encouraged to enter the field. Post 2001 technology bubble many people were under
            the false impression technology and computer jobs are unstable. There was a lot of fear that the field had a short life span and would
            burn out much like the fireworks on the Fourth of July.
